ember-oauth2
============

JavaScript library for using OAuth 2.0 Implicit Grant flow (Client-Side Flow) for Ember.js 

This creates an OAuth 2.0 Ember object class for handling authentication with OAuth 2.0 providers. 

## Dependencies

Ember-OAuth2 requires jQuery.

## Browser Support

Ember-OAuth2 uses localStorae for saving the tokens, localStorage is supported in Firefox 3.5+, Safari 4+, IE8+, and Chrome.

## Configure

First you must configure your OAuth provider. For Google you would configure it like this.

```javascript
  Ember.OAuth2.config = {
    google: {
      clientId: "xxxxxxxxxxxx",
      authBaseUri: 'https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth',
      redirectUri: 'https://oauth2-login-demo.appspot.com/oauth/callback',
      scope: 'public write'
    } 
  } 
```

The configuration object allows you to also customize the prefix for the state and token that are stored in the browsers localStorage. The default value for the state prefix is *state* and the default for token is *token*. Using the previous example you can customize the prefixes by doing the following.

```javascript
  Ember.OAuth2.config = {
    google: {
      clientId: "xxxxxxxxxxxx",
      authBaseUri: 'https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth',
      redirectUri: 'https://oauth2-login-demo.appspot.com/oauth/callback',
      scope: 'public write',
      statePrefix: 'foobar',
      tokenPrefix: 'qux'
    } 
  } 
```

After successful authorization and saving the access_token to the localStorage the `onSuccess` callback will be called. This will allow the user to do any cleanup necessary or to retrieve user information from the OAuth provider. To configure the callback reopen the class and and override the `onSuccess` and `onError` methods.

```javascript
  Ember.OAuth2.reopen({ onSuccess: function() { return 'hello, onSuccess' } });
  Ember.OAuth2.reopen({ onError: function() { return 'hello, onError' } });
```

* `clientId`: The client identifier that is used by the provider. Ember-OAuth2 uses the Implicit Grant flow (Client-Side Flow).
* `authBaseUri`: The authorization url for the OAuth2 provider.
* `redirectUri`: The URI that the OAuth2 provider will redirect back to when completed. 
* `scope`: Access your application is requesting from the OAuth2 provider.

## Authorization

To sign into the OAuth2 provider create a auth object.

```javascript
  App.oauth = Ember.OAuth2.create({providerId: 'bwh_anes_oauth2'});
  App.aouth.authorize();
```

Calling `authorize()` will open a new window and the OAuth provider's OAuth dialog will be displayed. If the user chooses to authenticate with your website upon authorization by OAuth provider the user will be redirected back to the redirectUri with the params access_token, token_type and state. 

At the redirectURI add the following to process the params returned from the OAuth provider

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Authorize</title> 
    <script>
      var hash = window.location.hash;
      window.opener.App.oauth.onRedirect(hash);
      window.close();
    </script>
  </head>
</html>
```

This will process the returned params and save the `provider_id`, `access_token`, `scope` and `expires_in` (the time the access_token will expire) to the localStorage. This localStorage can be accessed with the key `token-the_provider_id`.
